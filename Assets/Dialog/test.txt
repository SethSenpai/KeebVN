|*Anna woke up, the smooth grey concrete ceiling staring back at her, her head and shoulder ached. Badly. She groaned as she sat upright in the bed. It took a second before she realized she was in the first aid room of the school. The door of the small ward opened and the same guy from this morning walked into the door.
|*“Ah! You’re awake!” He smiled as he sat down on the little stool next to her bed. “you made quite an impression apparently. Tripping over a stray whiteboard eraser and banging your head on the floor, I don’t think such a display of acrobatics has ever been displayed in this school.” He grinned at his own little joke but quickly changed his attitude as he saw that Anna was on the verge of tears. 
|bg:1,ba:1*“Hey does it hurt so badly?” He held his hand to the side of her face, wiping away the tear rolling down her cheek. Anna shook her head. 
|*“M-m-my introduction.” She muttered as she looked away. “They must think I’m weird now.” She sniffed and looked back at him.
|*“Hey cheer up, you were just unlucky. I’m sure they won’t hold it against you.” He smiled and softly placed his hand on her head, rustling her hair. She sniffed again and softly asked. “A-a-are you the nurse here?” 
|*“Close! I’m actually an intern here.” Pushed some of his black hair away as he looked at her, his blue eyes filled with kindness. “You’re a senior here right? Must be tough transferring in here so late.” Anna nodded. “Seriously though, how are you feeling? It doesn’t seem like you have a concussion, not feeling dizzy or nauseous?”
