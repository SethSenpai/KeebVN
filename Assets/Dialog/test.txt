HHKB-san is one of the smartest keyboards at Keeb Academy. She often clashes with others due to her different layout, but has found a friend in Planck-san. Due to how she has been viewed with her switches and layout, she is often very aloof and cold toward people. She is really friendly when you get to know her, but until then, she acts very reserved.

HHKB-san has struggled to get along with many people due to her often aloof and cold attitude. Many people view her as an ‘elitist’ keyboard and often times just say her switches are ‘overrated.’ While HHKB-san shrugs these comments off, they still hurt her inside. She just wants to be typed on like any other keyboard. Will she find someone she can truly connect with?

HHKB-san is attending KB Academy through a scholarship. While at the top of her class, and almost the top of the school academically, HHKB-san is usually found either alone or with her one friend Planck-san. She and Planck-san became friends because it was convenient. Not that they don’t care about each other as friends, but that’s just how the situation ended up.
